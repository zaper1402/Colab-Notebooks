## Data Exploration

The dataset consists of NIR spectra from biomass samples with corresponding moisture content measurements.

The spectra cover wavelengths from approximately 800 to 2500 nm, which is typical for NIR analysis.

## Outlier Detection

We use PCA for initial visualization and Mahalanobis distance for statistical outlier detection.

The Mahalanobis distance helps identify samples that have unusual spectral characteristics:
